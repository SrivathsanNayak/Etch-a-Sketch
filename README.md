# Etch-a-Sketch

In this project, I created a browser-based version of a game similar to the Etch-a-Sketch toy.

This was a fun one as I learnt a lot of new concepts such as overlay, multiple event listeners, and more DOM stuff.

This project was made under The Odin Project.

Feel free to view the game here:
